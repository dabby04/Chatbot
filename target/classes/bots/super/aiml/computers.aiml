<category><pattern>WHAT ARE DEPRECATED *</pattern>
<template><br/>  One of the biggest challenges facing a Java application<br/>  developer is finding a "lowest common denominator" subset of the<br/>  Java language that works on all the platforms and versions<br/>  out there.  The Java language itself is a moving target.<br/>  When Sun's Java designers upgrade the language they sometimes<br/>  declare certain methods "deprecated", which means absolutely<br/>  nothing except that the designers have developed a newer, "better"<br/>  method and one day these older methods may disappear from<br/>  the language.  Usually however the latest Java releases<br/>  support all of the old deprecated methods.<br/>     <br/></template>
