<template>Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! i'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust?

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</pattern>
<template>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT _ CHILD MACHINE *</pattern>
<template>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL *</pattern>
<template>Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can  be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are  somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary  to face this awkwardness.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think></template>

</category>
<category><pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</pattern>
<template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>IS AI A BAD *</pattern>
<template><think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think>  The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since  artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be  impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.</template>
