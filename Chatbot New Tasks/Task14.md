# Personalizing Responses with AIML "that"

Task 14 focuses on leveraging the <that> tag in AIML to make chatbot conversations more contextually aware and dynamic. By incorporating the <that> tag, you can enable your chatbot to consider its previous response when determining how to reply to the current user input, facilitating a more coherent and natural dialogue flow. Example:

```
<category>
      <pattern>WHAT ABOUT MOVIES</pattern>
      <template>Do you like comedy movies</template>  
   </category>
   
   <category>
      <pattern>YES</pattern>
      <that>Do you like comedy movies</that>
      <template>Nice, I like comedy movies too.</template>
   </category>
   
   <category>
      <pattern>NO</pattern>
      <that>Do you like comedy movies</that>
      <template>Ok! But I like comedy movies.</template>
   </category> 

```
As you can see the last line printed on console by the  chatbot becomes the content in <that> tag
